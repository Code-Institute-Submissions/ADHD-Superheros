## Overview:

To create an app that encourages a positive mindset in the ADHD user by focusing on strengths and successes as well minimzing cognitivie overload by narrowing focus on top 3 most important tasks for the day. 

### Purpose: 

* What? 

1. ADHD is neurotypical developmental disorder charaterised by an impairment of executive function (mental proceses for used to manging day to day life and attainging goals). ADHD Ireland (https://adhdireland.ie/for-adults/adhd-in-adults/) share that adults with ADHD have problems in six major areas of executive functioning:

    * Activation – Problems with organization, prioritizing, and starting tasks.
    * Focus – Problems with sustaining focus and resisting distraction, especially with reading.
    * Effort – Problems with motivation, sustained effort, and persistence.
    * Emotion – Difficulty regulating emotions and managing stress.
    * Memory – Problems with short-term memory and memory retrieval.
    * Action – Problems with self-control and self-regulation.

* Why? 

1. Encourage a positive mindset at start of day - People with ADHD are neurodiverent individuals living in a neurotypical world. The world in general celebrates and rewards neurotypical traits which can leave ADHDers to dwell on their perceived weaknesses, shortcomings and failures. 

2. Optimise Daily Life while reducing cognitive overload - Apps recommended for people with ADHD are often focusing solely on organising their daily lives such as this ADHD app list here of calendars and todo list apps but none are uniquely designed for ADHDers:

* How? 

1. Focus on the positive - This app combines focusing on celebrating ADHD strengths and successes rather than dwelling on weaknesses and failings. 

2. Reduce cognitive overload - It uses the core funtion as a restrictive to-do list feature (top 3 daily priroties rather than any endless list of to-do items) to encourage hyperfocus while reminding the users of the amazing their amazing potential, key ADHD strengths and significant past succeses/wins.

## UX

### User Stories

Agreed:

* As a user, I need to see a daily reminder of a ADHD superpower/strength.
* As a user, I need to see a daily reminder of advice tailored to ADHDers.

* As a user, I need to review my top 3 priorities from the yeserday day and confirm done/not done.
* As a user, I need a weekly % of my task completion (one week = 21 tasks, 16 done on the day = 76%). 
* As a user, I need a monthly % of my task completion (one month = 90 tasks, 79 done on the day = 86%).

* As a user, I need to document my top 3 win/successes from the yesterday day.
* As a user, I need to be reminded of random wins/successes from any previous day except yesterday.
* As a user, I need to set my top 3 priorities for the current day.

To be considered:
