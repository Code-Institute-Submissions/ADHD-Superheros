### User Story Testing

* As a user, I need to see a daily reminder of an ADHD superpower/strength.
* As a user, I need to see a daily reminder of advice tailored to ADHDers.
* As a user, I need to review my top 3 priorities from yesterday day and confirm done/not done.
* As a user, I need a weekly % of my task completion (one week = 21 tasks, 16 done on the day = 76%). 
* As a user, I need a monthly % of my task completion (one month = 90 tasks, 79 done on the day = 86%).
* As a user, I need to document my top 3 wins/successes from yesterday.
* As a user, I need a reminder of random wins/successes from any previous day except yesterday.
